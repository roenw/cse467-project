CTGAN Synthetic Student Data Pipeline

Overview

This project uses CTGAN (Conditional Tabular GAN) to generate synthetic student performance data while evaluating both data utility and privacy. It is designed as a practical academic implementation for synthetic educational dataset generation and analysis.


Key Features

* Trains CTGAN on real student data
* Generates synthetic datasets of equal size
* Evaluates utility using:

  * KL Divergence
  * Jensen-Shannon Divergence
  * Wasserstein Distance
  * Chi-Square Test
  * Logistic Regression AUC
* Evaluates privacy using:

  * Delta Presence
  * K-Anonymity
  * Identifiability Score
* Produces:

  * `synthetic_students.csv`
  * `privacy_utility.json`
  * `comparison.png`

Installation

bash
pip install ctgan pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib

Usage

bash
python3 ctgan_full_pipeline.py


Input dataset:


Student_data.csv




 Method

1. Load and preprocess educational data
2. Train CTGAN model
3. Generate synthetic student records
4. Evaluate statistical similarity and privacy risks
5. Export reports and visualizations



Limitations

* Standard CTGAN only not dp
* No DPGAN/PATEGAN implementation
* Privacy metrics are approximations, not formal DP guarantees

Purpose

This pipeline provides a balanced framework for:

* Synthetic educational data generation
* Privacy analysis
* Utility benchmarking
* Academic research and coursework
